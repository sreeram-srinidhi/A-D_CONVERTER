# A-D_CONVERTER
 An analog-to-digital converter changes an analog signal that's continuous in terms of both time and
 amplitude to a digital signal that's discrete in terms of both time and amplitude.The analog input to
 a converter consists of a voltage that varies among a theoretically infinite number of values
 A/D converter follow a sequence when converting analog signals to digital. They first sample the
 signal, then quantify it to determine the resolution of the signal, and finally set binary values and send
 it to the system to read the digital signal. Two important aspects of the A/D converter are its sampling
 rate and resolution.
 The sampling rate is the number of samples taken per second. The units for sample rate are samples
 per second (sps) or Hertz (Hz).The A/D converter resolution is defined as the smallest incremental
 voltage that can be recognized and thus causes a change in the digital output. It is expressed as the
 number of bits output by the A/D converter.
